This project aims to achieve an understanding of the countries that have been affected by this disease mostly spreading awareness to more humid and hot places that have a higher chance of infection Showcasing the number of reported cases and deaths malaria has caused between the 1900's to the 2000's.

I have learnt from this project, how exactly malaria is contacted/spreaded with ways to prevent this occurance for example, using isect repellent or having functional insect misquito net above the bed.
